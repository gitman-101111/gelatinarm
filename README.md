# 🚨 DISCLAIMER 🚨
This was almost entirely generated by AI with guidance and oversight by someone extremely new to C# development.
I welcome anyone with more experience and knowledge to correct whatever you find and improve it!
It was created to fill my needs for a native Xbox client and my only hope for it is to be used (in any way, as a whole application or bits and pieces of code) by others :)

## 4K Playback on Xbox

Gelatinarm runs in standard app mode on Xbox, which means it prioritizes **background music playback** over expanded video resources. This is a deliberate design choice with the following implications:

### What this means for you:
- ✅ **Background music works perfectly** - Continue listening while playing games or using other apps
- ✅ **4K video playback is supported** - Within the standard memory constraints
- ✅ **HDR content works** - HDR10 on all models, Dolby Vision Profile 8.1 on Series S/X
- ⚠️ **Some 4K content may transcode** - If it exceeds memory limits, Jellyfin will automatically adjust

### Technical Background
Xbox apps must choose between two modes:
1. **Standard mode** (what Gelatinarm uses): Allows background audio but limits memory to ~1GB
2. **Expanded mode**: Provides 5GB+ memory for 4K video but disables all background functionality

We chose standard mode because background music is a core feature for most users. The app handles 4K content well within these constraints, and any content that needs more resources will be seamlessly transcoded by your Jellyfin server.

For more technical details about this Xbox limitation, see [Microsoft's documentation on HEVC video on Xbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/hevc-xbox).

### Supported Container Formats
Direct play support for all common containers:
- **MPEG-4**: MP4, M4V, MOV, M4A
- **Matroska**: MKV, WebM
- **Windows Media**: WMV, ASF, WMA
- **MPEG**: TS, M2TS, MTS, MPG, MPEG, VOB
- **Legacy**: AVI, FLV
- **Mobile**: 3GP, 3G2
- **Audio**: MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, ALAC, WMA, AMR

### Supported Subtitle Formats
- **SRT** - Most compatible, external and embedded
- **ASS/SSA** - Advanced styling preserved
- **VTT** - WebVTT format
- **PGS** - Blu-ray subtitles
- **VOBSUB** - Requires server-side burn-in

## Known Limitations

### Audio Playback with Embedded Artwork
- **Issue**: FLAC files with embedded artwork larger than ~1500×1500 pixels may fail to play directly
- **Cause**: Xbox MediaPlayer limitation with large embedded images
- **Solution**: The app automatically falls back to transcoding when this occurs
- **Workaround**: Ensure your Jellyfin server has separate album artwork

### Platform Limitations
- **External subtitles** - Only embedded subtitles are supported due to UWP MediaPlaybackItem architecture. External subtitle tracks must be added when creating the MediaPlaybackItem and cannot be dynamically changed during playback. Since we initialize playback in MediaPlayerPage, we cannot pre-load external subtitles. The app will automatically request the server to embed all subtitles in the stream.

## System Requirements

- Xbox One, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Xbox Series S, or Xbox Series X
- Internet connection
- Jellyfin server (version 10.8.0 or later recommended)
- Xbox configured to Developer Mode for sideloading (or install from Microsoft Store when available)

## Installation

### From Microsoft Store
Install directly from the Microsoft Store - search for "Gelatinarm" or use the link at the top of this page.

### Sideloading (Developer Mode)
1. Enable Developer Mode on your Xbox
2. Download the latest release package
3. Use the Xbox Device Portal to install the package
4. Launch Gelatinarm from your Apps list

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 with UWP development workload
- Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)

### Build Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Gelatinarm.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
3. Set configuration to Release and platform to x64
4. Build the solution
5. Deploy to your Xbox in Developer Mode

### Generating Store Release (Unsigned)

**Note**: This method is ONLY needed if you cannot sign the package due to cross-architecture limitations (e.g., building x64 packages on ARM machines). If you can sign normally in Visual Studio, use the standard publishing workflow instead.

#### When to Use This Method
- Building x64 packages on ARM development machines
- Cross-architecture builds where signing fails
- When Visual Studio's built-in Store publishing fails due to signing errors

#### 1. Update Version Number
- Open `Package.appxmanifest` in Visual Studio
- Go to the **Packaging** tab
- Increment the **Version** number (e.g., 1.0.1.0 → 1.0.2.0)
- Save the file

#### 2. Build Store Upload Package (PowerShell)
Run the following command from the project root:

```powershell
cd C:\gelatinarm
& 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe' `
    Gelatinarm.csproj `
    /p:Configuration=Release `
    /p:Platform=x64 `
    /p:UapAppxPackageBuildMode=StoreUpload `
    /p:AppxBundle=Always `
    /p:AppxPackageSigningEnabled=false `
    /p:AppxPackageDir=".\AppPackages\"
```

#### 3. Upload to Store
- The build creates an `.msixupload` or `.appxupload` file in `.\AppPackages\`
- Upload this file to Microsoft Partner Center
- Microsoft will sign the package with their certificate during publication

**Why Unsigned?** The `/p:AppxPackageSigningEnabled=false` parameter bypasses the signing step that fails when building for a different architecture than your development machine. Microsoft Store handles the final signing, so unsigned packages are acceptable for Store submission.
